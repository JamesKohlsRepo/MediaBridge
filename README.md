# What is MediaBridge?

MediaBridge is a project being developed at the [Noisebridge](https://github.com/noisebridge) hackerspace in San Francisco, CA, USA. See also the [Noisebridge hompage](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge) and the [wiki entry for this project](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Python_Project_Meetup).

MediaBridge is in a *very* early stage of the development. It's intended functionality is to provide recommendations that *bridge* media types. So for example, you might say you're interested in the film *Saw* and MediaBrige might recommend the video game *Silent Hill* or a Stephen King book. For now, we are working on simply returning recommendations for movies, based on the [Netflix Prize dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data).

Currently, we are only accepting contributions from members of the project who meet in person at Noisebridge.
